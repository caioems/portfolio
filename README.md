# Portfolio - Caio Souza

Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase my expertise with data handling. Throughout my academic and professional journey in the last 12 years, I have gained valuable experience in analyzing data for different kinds of technical reporting.

My background includes experiences in forestry and field surveying. Each project I undertook involved the meticulous collection, storage, and analysis of data from thousands of trees. These efforts aimed to uncover valuable insights into forest dynamics, spanning from comprehensive inventories, to biodiversity studies and assessments of factors that impacted both natural and commercial forests' health.

As a UAV specialist, I work extensively with spatial data, handling every aspect from data collection and processing to GIS-level analysis, primarily for environmental compliance and quality assessments. Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, I created spatial databases, carried out geospatial analyses, extracted valuable insights, and tailored reports to meet each client's demands.

Below, you'll find a curated selection of projects showcasing my expertise in data preprocessing, analysis and visualization. Explore my complete portfolio to check my capabilities. Let's unlock data's full potential for informed decision-making.
