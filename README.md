# Portfolio - Caio Souza

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio, where I showcase my expertise in the field. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have gained valuable experience in analyzing data for various purposes. Despite the fact that I have worked on different kinds of projects, my main topics of interest have been forestry and environmental licensing. I currently work as a drone operator as well, using drones to collect field data.

I have worked on numerous data analysis projects in the field of forestry, including assessments of forest inventories, investigations into biodiversity, and analyses of the variables affecting the health of natural forests.

Furthermore, my role as a drone operator has allowed me to gather high-resolution data and perform its analysis on GIS level for environmental assessments and impact evaluations. By utilizing high resolution aerial imagery, I have played a crucial part in monitoring habitat changes and analyzing environmental conditions.

You can find a selection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and producing useful insights in my portfolio. I am interested about using data analysis approaches to promote positive changes in the forestry and environmental sectors, with a focus on converting raw data into relevant narratives.

Please feel free to further browse my portfolio to see the range and depth of my experience in the field of data analysis. Together, we can discover the data's hidden potential and use it to make wise choices that will lead to a sustainable future.
